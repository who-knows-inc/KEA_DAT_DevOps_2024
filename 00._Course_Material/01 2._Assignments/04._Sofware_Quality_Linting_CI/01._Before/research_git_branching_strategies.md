# Research Branching strategies

**Type**: Individual

**Deadline**: Will be useful to have a good overview ahead of the lecture and be ready to discuss it with your group and implement one after. 

**Motivation**: This assignment will help you with the task that follows the lecture, which is to choose a branching strategy.

## General Research

This is a daunting task. Everyone is required to research the topic so that the group can make an informed decision. I have tried to mark things as required / not required to make time management easier. 

Here is a long course on Git. You are not required to watch this video but do jump around and see if there are any interesting concepts and terminology you can gain from it:

## Merging vs. Rebasing

Really nice visuals to explain Git Merge vs. Rebase:
