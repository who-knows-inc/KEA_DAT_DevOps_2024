# [Highly Optional] Your Infrastructure as Code

Achieve consistency, efficiency, scalability, reproducibility, automation, versioning, portability, collaboration, agility and resilience.

**Type**: Group work

**Motivation**: You know all the reasons why.

## Scope

Replicate your infrastructure using Terraform.

Remember that this is a **highly optional** task. 

Feel free to only replicate parts of your infrastructure. 

And you could also use it to provision new resources without being the ones used in production.
