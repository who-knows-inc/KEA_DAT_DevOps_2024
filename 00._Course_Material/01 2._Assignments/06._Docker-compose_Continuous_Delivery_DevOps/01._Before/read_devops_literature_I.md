## Read DevOps Literature II

Note that there is more reading material for before the guest lecture next week. It can be found [here](../../07._Guest_Lecture/01._Before/read_devops_literature_II.md).

I consider the task of reading the literature before the guest lecture to be of a higher priority to the Continuous Delivery assignment.
