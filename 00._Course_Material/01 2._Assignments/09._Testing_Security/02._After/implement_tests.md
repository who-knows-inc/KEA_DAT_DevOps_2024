# Implement tests

Implement various types of tests as part of your development process. 

**Type**: Group work

**Motivation**: Make your application more robust and avoid fatal errors in the rest of the course.

# When to implement 

Notice that it says to implement tasks as part of your development process; not just CI/CD.

Tests can run locally before pushing to the repository.

Tests can also run after a new version of the application has been deployed.

# What to implement

It is required to implement:

- Unit tests

- Integration tests. For inspiration to end-to-end tests with Playwright check out https://github.com/who-knows-inc/whoknows_variations/tree/end-to-end_testing

Feel free to implement other types of tests as well.

Please consider all types of test and remember why you decided that they were not relevant to the project.

# How much to implement

For the sake of the course it is better to setup a variety of tests to show that you can rather than performing one type of tests exhaustively.
