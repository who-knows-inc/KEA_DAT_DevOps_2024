## Alternatives to GitHub

Using GitHub is not mandatory in this course. Both Gitlab and Bitbucket offer services similar to GitHub Actions. Or you could even host your own git server and setup CI/CD manually.

The course resources will assume that your group went with GitHub and tutorials will all focus on GitHub.

## [Group] GitHub organizations

With your designated semester groups create a new [organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch). 

1. Create an organization.

2. Add each other as collaborators on the organization level. Give everyone admin rights. 

3. [Optional] Create a `test` repository in the organization.

4. [Optional]  Clone the repository and push a change on the main branch. 

Do not fork the repository. Forking it creates a new repository. 

Now that you are collaborators you can work on the same repository. 

5. [Optional]  Delete the `test` repository. 

6. Create (a) joint repositor(y/ies) as you see fit.

## Naming 

You are free to name the repositories and the search engine whatever your like. 

You are not required to go with the WhoKnows branding.

---

## Make the main code repositories public

The course aims to teach you techniques on how to never push sensitive information 

---

## License

Because of the previous point, it is important that you consider the [license types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_license#Software_copyright) for your repositories.

If you use a permissive license, you will allow other groups to reuse your code. 

Unlike popular belief, no license does not entail free for all. Having no license is the most restrictive type and will legally disallow other groups from using your work.
