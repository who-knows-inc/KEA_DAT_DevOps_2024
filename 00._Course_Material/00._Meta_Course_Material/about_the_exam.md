## Collaboration

While it's a group exam you will be graded individually. 

An important part of this course is to learn to work together. It's not just about technologies. Culture is one of the keystones of what it means to be DevOps.

## The deployment

What is interesting is that the life span of the application is known in advance. 

You can take down the services once the simulation stops. 

The system must be deployed during the exam. This might mean that you will run out of credit if you are only using a single students' account. 

Don't worry about this part yet. You will learn how to make your life easier the second time around.

## Solution agnostic

During the lectures and the guides focus on a certain way of doing DevOps. 

Don’t wanna use GitHub Actions and want to use CI/CD tools (Travis CI, Jenkins etc.) instead? Great!

Don’t want to use Terraform and want to use Vagrant or Serverless Framework etc.? Great!

That's why I have provided the requirements mentioned below.

## Requirements

I have provided some documents containing the minimum requirements for the exam. Your grade will depend on how much work you put into the project.

I also provide suggestions and guides on how to implement certain things. You can consider them as a fallback if you are stuck. 

What will elevate you is if your group either makes great choices based on research or gain a fresh understanding of the different approaches, the pros and cons of each. Basically, reflecting on your choices. 

The requirement documents are:

- [Exam report requirements](./exam_requirements_report.md)
