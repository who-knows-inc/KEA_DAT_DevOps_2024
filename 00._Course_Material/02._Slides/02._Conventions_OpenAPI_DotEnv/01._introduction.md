# How's it going?

* Did you manage to create a valid pull request to repositories.py?

# How did the dependency graph task go?


There are tools that could help you with this task such as:

- [`debtree`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/debtree.1.html) to create a dependency graph of the Debian packages for the application running on the server.

- [`pipdeptree`](https://pypi.org/project/pipdeptree/) for the pure Python dependencies.

# A small correction

You can name your projects and search whatever you like. 

You are not required to go with the WhoKnows branding. 

It doesn't make sense to call it `variations` because the variations repository is named that for containing multiple variations of the same project. 

I should've made that clearer during week 1.

You can always rename your repositories and make a new PR.

Be nice! Make PRs of a readable size.

# Why do we do that? Why do I have to understand other peoples' code?

> **Unfortunately, computer programming education often focuses on how to single-handedly develop programs from scratch in a single language and single execution environment**, a development style prevalent in the 1950s and 60s. **Nowadays, software development is typically a team-based activity and most often involves extending and maintaining existing systems written in a multitude of languages for diverse execution environments**. Itâ€™s now even more important to understand code concepts, forms, structures, and idioms to be able to write code that other programmers can read easily.

# Work systematically

While working, take notes of what you are doing.

A text file in your workspace might serve you well as a notebook.

Keep a record of when you did what.

Note down what went wrong, where you found a solution, and keep a link for that.

**This is a course requirement that will not be given as a weekly assignment since it should be done from start until the end.**
