# A thorough discussion on the pros and cons of defining secrets in config files vs. environment variables

If you are interested:

https://serverfault.com/questions/892481/what-are-the-advantages-of-putting-secret-values-of-a-website-as-environment-var

We will work with environment variables defined in config files called dotenv. 

Dotenv exists across many languages. The standard is that the files are named `.env`.

---

# Defining it locally 

Let's use dotenv in Python first, then Node.js.

# Python: Virtual environments

Mac users can't run pip globally because of the way Python is installed which restricts `pip` to avoid breaking the system Python or Homebrew setup. 

Mac users try to run `pip install python-dotenv` and see what happens.

While other OS users can run pip globally, it's not recommended. *Can you think of reasons why?*

**Solution**: Virtual environments!

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

You can always deactivate with:

```bash
$ deactivate
```

---

# Install dotenv for Python

This is the package:

https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/

Note that the package to install is called `python-dotenv` but we import the library as `dotenv`. This is because of how modules work in Python. 


Once the virtual environment is activated install the package:

```bash
$ pip install python-dotenv
```

Bonus: You can run Python with Nodemon for hot reload with the following command:

```bash
$ nodemon --exec python your_script.py
```

---

# Python: Two ways to use dotenv

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
print(os.getenv("API_KEY"))

```

Or:

```python
from dotenv import dotenv_values

config = dotenv_values(".env")
print(config["API_KEY"])
```

---

# Create a template file!

Your `.env` should be added to .gitignore and never pushed. 

Create a copy of your `.env` file and remove the sensitive information but keep the keys and perhaps add example values. 

This file should be pushed. There is no single naming convention but usually they are called something similar to:

- `.env.example`
- `.env.sample`
- `.env.template`

*What is the purpose of doing this?*

# In GitHub Action - Manually

```yaml
name: Create .env file

on: [push]


jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
        - name: Create .env file
          run: |
            echo "API_KEY=${{ secrets.ENV_API_KEY }}" >> .env
            echo "OTHER_SECRET=${{ secrets.ENV_OTHER_SECRET }}" >> .env
```

You don't *have* to prepend the secrets with `ENV_` but it's a nice way to show that they are different from other secrets and their purpose.

# In GitHub Action - Marketplace extension


Using [SpicyPizza/create-envfile@v2.0](https://github.com/SpicyPizza/create-envfile) is a very popular way of doing it:

```yaml
name: Create .env file

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Create .env file
        uses: SpicyPizza/create-envfile@v2.0
        with:
          envkey_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ENV_API_KEY }}
          envkey_OTHER_SECRET: ${{ secrets.ENV_OTHER_SECRET }}
          file_name: .env
```

---

# With docker-compose.yaml

**Example 1**: Defining environment variables:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    environment:
      - PUBLIC_KEY=publickey
      - NOT_SECRET=thisisnotsecret
```

**Example 2**: Defining secrets and reading them from .env files into the environment example:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    env_file:
      - /path/to/your/env/.env
```

Then access them in your programming language how you normally would.
