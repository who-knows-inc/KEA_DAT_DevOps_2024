# Let's install GitHub CLI (`gh`)

https://cli.github.com/


This is required only once:

```bash
$ gh auth login
```

Then we can run commands like:

```bash
$ gh repo create
$ gh repo delete
$ gh issue create
$ gh pr create
$ gh workflow run
```

...and many more.

# How to create a workflow

Create any YAML file in the .github/workflows directory.

---

# YAML indentation should be 2 spaces

The problem is that VSCode defaults to 4 spaces (in the workflows folder). Here is how to change it:

# Alternatives offered by other Git platforms


- **BitBucket**: Atlassian Bamboo:

# Why use GitHub Actions?

* (+) You are already using GitHub

* (+) It’s free with some limitations (but the alternatives have the same limitation)

https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes

* (-) The free version is slow

# GitHub Actions Marketplace

Contains useful templates for Actions

Community Actions

Create custom actions and upload them to the marketplace

# GitHub Actions (terminology) - I

**Event**: Triggers that start a workflow

**Workflows**: Defines an automation from start to finish

**Jobs**: A workflow contains one or more jobs. A job is one or more steps.

**Steps**: Simple commands, shell scripts or actions. Steps can’t run in parallel. Runs in sequence from top to bottom.


---

# GitHub Actions (terminology) - II

**Runner**: Compute layer where jobs are executed. Each job has its own runner.

Runners can run in parallel.

GitHub provides 3 types of runners: Ubuntu, Windows and MacOS.

Using a self-hosted runner is also possible.

GitHub runners comes with pre-installed tools, runtimes and compilers that require minimal configuration.

I really recommend this video.

His others videos in the series are unfortunately not as useful. (I mention this so you can better invest your time).

# Technical requirements:

Workflows must be stored in the `.github/workflows` folder.

Workflows are defined with YAML.

Workflows must define:

* Trigger and branches 
* Permissions
* Job and runner 
* Steps

# Workflows from templates

Check out the actions tab in the repository to discover preset workflow templates. 

<div>
    <img src="./assets_github_actions/workflow_template.png" alt="Preset workflow from template" style="height: 45vh;" />
</div>

---

# Choose an action from the marketplace

In the actions tab choose this workflow:

<img src="./assets_github_actions/node_github_action_marketplace.png" alt="Node GitHub Actions Marketplace" style="height: 30vh;">

---

# The checkout action (actions/checkout@v3)

Allows one to clone the repository code to the runner. 

Made by GitHub: https://github.com/actions/checkout

The following can be spicied: 

`@<tag>`, `@<branch>`, `@<commit_sha>`

---

# Let's do it ourselves from scratch!

But this time manually (this is how we will be doing it from now on).

```bash
$ gh repo create

$ mkdir .github

$ cd .github

$ mkdir workflow

$ cd workflows
```

Create hello_world.yaml


---

# Hello World workflow

Let's manually create a workflow that echoes (logs) "Hello World" on every push and PR.

1. Create a new repository. 

2. Create .github/workflows

3. In it, create a file called hello_world.yaml

---

# In hello_world.yaml 


```yaml
name: Hello world workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  hello:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run hello world
        run: echo "Hello world"
        shell: bash
```

---

# Let's study the above snippet - Can you spot the uneccessary part?

---

# workflow_dispatch

workflow_dispatch provides a UI button so that a workflow can be triggered in the GitHub UI without the above event triggers.

Under the `on` key add the following: 

```yaml
on: 
    workflow_dispatch:
```

<!-- GitHub Issues Workflow -->

# Let's try to automate publishing a comment every time an issue is created

What is a GitHub Issue? Why is auto-commenting useful?

---

# GitHub Actions - Context

Contexts inject useful information into the server environment. 

Can be accessed via `${{ <context> }}`.

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts

For example, we can access repository meta information through `${{ github }} `. 

*Let's look for where the issue number is defined.*

---

# Dump the context to examine it

```yaml
name: Create a comment on new issues

permissions:
    issues: write

on:
    issues:
        types: [opened]

jobs:
    comment:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: "Dump GitHub context"
                run: echo '${{ toJson(github) }}' | jq
```

*Where is the issue number?*

---

# Found it?

Under issue it is called "number". 

Note: toJson is a utility provided by GitHub Actions.

---

# Use the following package

https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-or-update-comment

But replace issue-number: 1 with: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}

```yaml
        - name: Create comment
        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v3
        with:
            issue-number: 1
            body: |
            This is a multi-line test comment
            - With GitHub **Markdown** :sparkles:
            - Created by [create-or-update-comment][1]

            [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-comment
            reactions: '+1'
