# Docker terminology?

**Image**

**Container**

**Volume**

**Networking**

*Can you give informal definitions for these?*

---

# Docker terminology (informal)

**Image**: Blueprint / Recipe

**Container**: The instance of the image

**Volume**: Holds the data of the containers

**Networking**: Enables the pieces to speak


---

# Basic CLI example

Run the [hello-world container](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world/) from DockerHub and delete it after its execution:

```bash
$ docker run --rm hello-world
```

---

# Overview with Redis example

[https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/](Redis is a popular key-value store). 

*Can you explain the following commands?*

```bash
$ docker pull redis
$ docker run redis
```

Run in detached mode:

```bash
$ docker run -d redis
$ docker ps
$ docker stop <container-id>
```

# Alpine Linux

[Alpine Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux) is a very lightweight Linux distribution.

Get an interactive [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) shell:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm alpine /bin/sh
```

`-it` is short for `i` = `--interactive` and `t` = `--tty` (Pseudo-TTY).

**Note**: Windows users might need to prefix the `docker run` with `winpty`.

Go back to the local terminal by typing `exit` in the container shell.

```bash
/ # exit
```

    <h1>Volumes</h1>

# Volumes

You can mount directories (volumes) from your host to a container using the `-v` flag.

1. Create a directory with a file in it locally:

    ```bash
    $ mkdir mydockerdata
    $ echo 'Hello from the host!' > ./mydockerdata/mountedfile.txt
    ```

2. Run an Alpine container and mount the directory:

    ```bash
    $ docker run -it -v ./mydockerdata:/data alpine:latest /bin/sh
    ```

*Where can I find the file?*


---

# Volumes - II

*What happens if you delete the `mydockerdata` folder locally?* 

*Let's try it*. First delete the folder locally.


1. Find the container ID:

    ```bash
    $ docker ps -a
    ```

2. Start the container and attach it to interact with it:

    ```bash
    $ docker start <CONTAINER_ID>
    $ docker attach <CONTAINER_ID>
    ```

In the container run:

```bash
$ cat /data/mountedfile.txt
```

---

# Create a volume for data

Create a volume:

```bash
$ docker volume create test-volume
```

Use the volume in a container:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm -v test-volume:/mydata alpine /bin/sh
```

In the Alpine shell add a file to the `mydata` directory:

```bash
/ # echo 'Hello from the volume!' > /mydata/volume.txt
```

---

# Check out the content of the volume

The best way to interact with the volume is through the container. 

You could run Docker with elevated privileges to access the volume directly, but it's not recommended.

```bash
$ docker volume inspect test-volume
```

In Docker Desktop, choose volumes and choose `test-volume` to see the content.

# Why volumes?

*Can you give examples of what you would want to mount in a Docker container?*

---

# Volumes: That's why!

Database data:

```bash
$ docker run -d -v /my/local/data:/var/lib/mysql mysql:latest
```

Configuration files:

```bash
$ docker run -d -v /my/local/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf nginx:latest
```

Sharing data between containers:

```bash
$ docker run -d -v /my/local/data:/shared/data webserver:latest
$ docker run -d -v /my/local/data:/shared/data worker:latest
```

Source code, persistent storage for applications (fx. CMS), storing log files, SSL certificates, backup local data in a container etc.

<div class="title-card">
    <h1>Docker Networking</h1>
</div>

---

# Docker Networking

Let's explore networks in Docker by creating a network and then have two containers join it.

Create a network:

```bash
$ docker network create mynetwork
```

Run two named containers on the `mynetwork` network:

```bash
$ docker run -dit --name container1 --network mynetwork alpine:latest
$ docker run -dit --name container2 --network mynetwork alpine:latest
```

`-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).

`-i`: Keeps STDIN open even if not attached (interactive mode).

`-t`: Allocates a pseudo-TTY (a terminal interface).

---

# Verify networking between the containers

Access `container1` by attaching it:

```bash
$ docker attach container1
```
From `container1` ping `container2` (with example response):

```bash
/ # ping container2
PING container2 (172.18.0.3): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.18.0.3: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.075 ms
...
...
```

After a while stop the ping by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

If you see no packet loss, the containers are connected. Example:

```txt
--- container2 ping statistics ---
37 packets transmitted, 37 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.110/0.225/0.566 ms
```

---

# Expose ports to the host

Run an Nginx Container:

```bash
$ docker run -dit --name webserver --network mynetwork -p 8080:80 nginx:latest
```

Check out `http://localhost:8080` in a browser.

In `container2` request the webserver on the same network (install CURL first):

```bash
/ # apk add curl
/ # curl http://webserver
```

Inspect the network to see which containers are connected and their IP addresses. 

```bash
$ docker network inspect mynetwork
```

---

# Clean up!

```bash
$ docker stop container1 container2 webserver
$ docker rm container1 container2 webserver
$ docker network rm mynetwork
```
