# What are [development containers](https://containers.dev/)?

Dev containers allows you to run your code in a container.

But it can also specify the surrounding environment, like the tools you need to run your code.

For instance, you could specify what IDE extensions should be installed for a specific project without installing them on your local machine.

It can then easily be shared or run in the cloud.

# IDE support

Dev containers were developed for VSCode but support has been added for Visual Studio.

IntelliJ currently has early support for it as of now. You can keep track of updates to the support:
