# What is the most important thing to remember when choosing a database?

---

# It should be the right choice for your use case

There are many other arguments to consider, but if the above condition is not satisfied then the rest is irrelevant.

Discussion: *Is the argument "that's the database I know best" valid?*

# Should you use an ORM?

In this project, given its scope, fixed deadline and data complexity an ORM does not make sense. 

I want you to be aware that it is not always a good choice.

An ORM is often slower than writing raw SQL. An ORM is not "more secure". 

When creating a small project or MVP, developers waste time per default on setting up an ORM.

I will accept during the exam that the reason you set up an ORM was to learn how to use it for the language you are using.

# PostgreSQL vs. MySQL

MySQL is a proprietary database, while PostgreSQL is open-source. 

Scalability and high available features for MySQL are locked behind the Enterprise Edition.  

MySQL is more used, historically, but that's changing as PostgreSQL is [the preferred choice today](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-databases).

PostGreSQL supports JSON and JSONB data types, while MySQL has limited support.
