# The LIKE operator vs. FTS5

Example of a query using the `LIKE` operator:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pages WHERE content LIKE '%search%';
```

Create a FTS5 table:

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE pages USING fts5(title, content);
```

Example with FTS5 (search, searches, searching, searched and more):

```sql
SELECT * FROM pages WHERE pages MATCH 'search';
```

With wildcards (run, ran, rain and so many more):

```sql
SELECT * FROM pages WHERE pages MATCH 'r*n';
```

---

# FTS5

* **Indexing**: While the LIKE operator performs a sequential scan over rows, FTS5 uses tokenization and word positions to create an index for words.

* **Tokenization**: FTS5 breaks down the text into words.

* **Search capabilities**: FTS5 allows for more complex search queries: pattern matching with `%` and wildcards with `*`. Supports proximity matching. 

* **Performance**: FTS5 is faster than the LIKE operator.

# ElasticSearch

It's a NoSQL, JSON-based search engine. Documents are stored in collections. 

* (+) Can handle large amounts of data.

* (+) Fast.

* (+) Scalable. Can be distributed. 

* (+) Can perform many types of searches.

* (+) The ability to define custom queries and algorithms.


---

# Supported types of searches

- full-text search

- fuzzy search (approximates for typos)

- semantic search (search for meaning based on NLP (understands context rather than lexical search))

- autocomplete

- geospatial search (search within bounding boxes, circles, polygons)

- aggregations (grouping and counting)

- similarity search (search for similar documents/[images](https://www.elastic.co/blog/overview-image-similarity-search-in-elastic)) 

...and much more.

# Do you need ElasticSearch?

For this project FTS5 in SQLite or [Full Text Search](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html) in PostgreSQL should be enough.

But ElasticSearch is useful to learn and is often part of many poupular monitor stacks (today's other topic).
 
*What requirements would necessitate the use of ElasticSearch?*

---

# When to use ElasticSearch

Your system:

* has a large amount of data (hundreds of gigabytes).

* needs to be scalable.

* needs to be distributed.

* requires support for complex search queries.

* requires support for custom queries and algorithms.

# Indexing and Retrieval

There are two phases in the process: **indexing** and **retrieval**.

The retrieval is based on the score of the index calculated during the indexing.

# Inverted indices

Next couple of slides and the image below is inspired by this great talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWKEphKIG8U

*What does this remind you of?*

# Disclaimer

The following 5 slides are meant for those curious about how indexing and ranking works.

You are not expected to learn or memorize the terminology. 

---

# Index Scoring

ElasticSearch then attaches a score to each index. 

The score is based on the **number of appearances**.

But it also gains points for the **proximity of the words**. In the previous example, seraching for `"row boat"` would find document 1.

Chicken would get extra points for being a **rare word** in my documents. For instance, the search `"What is a chicken?"` would find the chicken document rather than the thousands of documents with the other words in that phrase.

The score is more complicated than that, but these are some of the factors taken into account.

# ElasticSearch Analyzers create Terms

Analyzers break text (and words) into **terms**.

* stopwords: common words that are ignored (`the`, `a`, `is`, etc.)

* stemming: words are reduced to their root form (running -> run) (searches -> search)

* punctuation: removed

* case-folding: all words are converted to lowercase

---


# Simplified Ranking Algorithm

Term Frequency (**TF**) - how often a term appears in a document. TF is normalized to avoid bias towards longer documents.
  
  \- `TF = Term Frequency / Total number of terms in the document`

Document Frequency (**DF**) - how often a term appears in the collection.

Inverse Document Frequency (**IDF**) - `log(total documents/DF)`

`Relevance = TF * IDF`

---

# Simplified Ranking Score Example

*The word "chicken" appears 3 times in document 2 and document 2 has 60 words. There is a total of 10 documents and chicken appears in 2 documents.*

<img src="./assets_searching/relevance_score.png" alt="relevant score" style="width: 38vh;">

Let's calculated the index score for document 2.

`TF`: Term appears 3 times out of the 60 terms in the document: `3/60 = 0.05`

`DF`: Term appears in two documents: `2` 

`IDF`: `log(total documents/DF) = log(10/2) = log(5) = 0.699`

`Relevance = TF * IDF = 0.05 * 0.699 = 0.03495`


---

# BM25

[Okapi Best Matching 25 (BM25)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) is widely used.

Besides the length of the document, it also accounts for the average length of all documents in the collection.

But BM25 is a [bag-of-words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) retrieval function and does not account for proximity which ElasticSearch does.

# Taking semantic HTML into account

Google considers many things besides [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank). On of them is the HTML structure when ranking.

Terms in `<title>`, `<meta>` and `<h1>` tags on the page are given more weight than terms in `<p>` tags.

The length of the content and the position where the term appears on the page are also taken into account.

In our example we will treat all page text as equal and throw it into the ElasticSearch document.

---

# Modern Search Engines - other considerations

- **Page Speed**: Faster pages are ranked higher.

- **Mobile Friendliness**: Pages that are mobile-friendly are ranked higher.

- **URL structure**: URLs that are easy to read and understand are ranked higher.

- **HTTPS**: Secure pages are ranked higher.

- **Domain Age**: Older domains are ranked higher.

And so much more. A lot of it is held secret by Google.

There are over [200 known factors](https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors) that Google uses to rank.

SEO is the opposite task of optimizing for search engines.

# CharFilter - HTML strip

A CharFilter goes char by char and replace or remove characters.

It could be useful to use HTML_strip to remove HTML tags.

```json
{
  "char_filter": {
    "html_strip": {
      "type": "html_strip"
    }
  }
}
```
