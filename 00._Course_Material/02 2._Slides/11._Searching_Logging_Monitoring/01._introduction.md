# Let's review your projects!

This is what I have found by using the website as a normal user would. I have not reviewed the security feature for old accounts.

**TeamAB**: A visual problem you have inherited from the legacy project. Change the Favicon from the default Vite one. 

**CEM**: Really nice announcement but if this is all you do, then it's not enough.

**Ukendt Gruppe**: Search isn't working? Same visual bug as TeamAB.

**LAWNE-KEA**: No HTTPS. Multiple visual problems. Try to make it look like a professional product. Search doesn't work. 

**OBS**: Remove the footer if it doesn't do anything besides saying "FOOTER". I don't see any weather page.

# Let's review your projects!!

**MadeInChina-DevOps**: No HTTPS. Same visual bug. Make the look more professional. No need to have a "Go Back" link embedded in pages. 

**UpsDev42069**: No HTTPS. Same visual bug. Change the favicon + tab title. Weather page doesn't work. Search doesn't work. 

**Integration Nation**: Really nice [weather page](https://40-85-136-203.nip.io/weather). Change the favicon + tab title. The Logo links to a different website. Consider making the search more user-friendly. 

**Team-Dood**: `502 Bad Gateway - nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)`

**AN-devOps**: No HTTPS. The server is inaccessible.

# Remember to be DevOps

I can task you to do technical assignments but you have to solve the DevOps task yourself.

There is guaranteed to be friction in your group. 

*How do identify problems?*

*How do you solve them?*

*How do you achieve psychological safety in your group so that members can speak out about the issues?*

If I ask you in the Exam how the group work was and you say "perfect" and nothing more I will be sceptical.

Take this reflection-solving mentality with you when you write your thesis.

# Indexing the database

*Did you do it*? 

*Can you tell me how much faster your response times have become? How can you check?*
