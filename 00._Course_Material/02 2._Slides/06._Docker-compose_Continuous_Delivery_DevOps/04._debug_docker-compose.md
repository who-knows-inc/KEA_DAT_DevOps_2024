# Let's set up a Node.js project

In a new directory:

```bash
$ npm init -y
$ npm install express
```

In the top-level of package.json add `type: module`.

---

# Let's create a simple Express server

In `app.js`:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send({ data: 'Hello World!'});
});

app.listen(80, () => {
    console.log('App running on port 80');
});
```

---

# Create the faulty `Dockerfile`

In the root of the project create a `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

---

# Create the faulty `docker-compose.yml`

<!-- In the root of the project create a `docker-compose.yml`: -->

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    networks:
      - app_net

  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: root
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass123
    networks:
      - db_net

networks:
  app_net:
    driver: bridge
  db_net:
    driver: bridge
```

---

# Let's run it

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

---

# Did it start?

Is the process is running? How do we check?

    <!-- ```bash -->

    <!-- ``` -->

How do we check the logs?

    <!-- ```bash -->
    $ docker-compose logs <container_name>

# You might've noticed it when running `docker-compose up --build`

But the it doesn't run because it expect to find a start script in `package.json`.

Add it:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js"
}
```

Run `docker-compose up --build` again and check if it's running.

```bash
$ docker-compose ps
```

---

# Check the logs

You should be able to guess the `container_name` based on how it named the db service:

```bash
$ docker logs <container_name>
```

There doesn't seem to be any startup errors. It's running as it should on port `80`.

---

# Verify what ports have been opened in the container

See which ports have been opened in the container:

```bash
$ docker ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Ports}}"
```

`ss` is a utility to investigate sockets. It's an alternative to `netstat`. 

```bash
$ docker exec -it <container_name> ss -tuln
```

---

# Let's see if the environment variables work 

In `app.js`, change the route to the following:

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send({ data: `Hello from the ${process.env.NODE_ENV} environment` });
});
```

Where has the `NODE_ENV` environment variable been set? What do we expect it to be?

Rerun `docker-compose up --build` and check in the browser if it works. 

---

# It doesn't work

In the browser it says:

```json
{
  "data": "Hello from the undefined environment"
}
```

Let's see if the environment variable is set in the container.

```bash
$ docker exec <container_name> env | grep NODE_ENV
```

---

# The way we defined the environment variable is incorrect

In the `docker-compose-yml` file, we can use either:

```yaml
  environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
```

or

```yaml
  environment:
      - NODE_ENV: production
```

---

# Let's test out the database

Install the PostgreSQL driver (`pg`):

```bash
$ npm install pg
```

Add this to the `app.js`:

```javascript
import pkg from 'pg';
const { Pool } = pkg;

const pool = new Pool({
  user: process.env.POSTGRES_USER,
  host: 'db',
  database: 'postgres',
  password: process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD,
  port: 5432,
});

pool.query('SELECT NOW()', (err, res) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log(res.rows[0]);
  }
});
```

---

# First: Let's debug the container

Verify the database container is running:

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose ps
  ```

Check logs for database startup issues:

  ```bash
  $ docker logs <db_container_name>
  ```

---

# Next: Let's debug the connection

Pre-debug step: Install `ping` in the app container:

  ```bash
  $ docker exec -it <app_container_name> apt-get update
  $ docker exec -it <app_container_name> apt-get install -y iputils-ping
  ```

Test connection between containers (using Dockerâ€™s built-in networking):

  ```bash
  $ docker exec -it <app_container_name> ping db
  ```

We are **not** able to ping it.

Try connecting manually to the db container:

  ```bash
  $ docker exec -it <db_container_name> psql -h db -U root -d postgres
  ```

But we *are* able to access the database.

---

# See which networks the containers are connected to

List all networks:

```bash
$ docker network ls
```

Check which networks the containers are connected to:

```bash
$ docker inspect <app_container_name> --format='{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}' | jq '.[].NetworkID'
$ docker inspect <db_container_name> --format='{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}' | jq '.[].NetworkID'
```

`.[].NetworkID'` is a `jq` filter to only display the network id. You can also try without it.

The networks have different ids. They are not connected to the same network.

---

# Simplify the `docker-compose.yml` and let them join the same network

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production

  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: root
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass123
```

---

# Problems with the environment variables again

To see the environment variables in the container:

```bash
$ docker exec <container_name> env
```

*What is the problem? How do we fix it?*

<details> 
  <summary>Solution</summary>
    
  The environment variables have not been defined on the app container. 
  There are better solutions but one could simply add them to the compose file:

  ```yaml
  environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: root
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass123
  ```
