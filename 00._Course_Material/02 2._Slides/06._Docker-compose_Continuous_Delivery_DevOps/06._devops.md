# Why DevOps?

*DevOps is an easy sell because it is focused on creating value (for the business > for customers > for developers):*

Easy to make small changes and fix bugs ⇒ better product for user ⇒ business makes cash

Quicker way to deploy new features ⇒ competitive product on the market ⇒ business makes cash

Tests ensure robustness ⇒ production isn’t down ⇒ business makes cash

Server access isn’t given freely ⇒ better security means lesser chance of hacking ⇒ business makes cash

Infrastructure is reproducible ⇒ recovery takes minutes rather than days or weeks ⇒ business makes cash

# Historical View 

Before DevOps: release cycle: months - years

Ideal: Multiple times a day

Goal: How do we create infrastructure to reach the ideal without firefighting

Why? To bring value to the users

# The role of operations in a DevOps company

Dianne Marsh, Director of Engineering Tools at Netflix, states that her team’s
charter is to “support our engineering teams’ innovation and velocity. We don’t
build, bake, or deploy anything for these teams, nor do we manage their
configurations. Instead, we build tools to enable self-service. It’s okay for people
to be dependent on our tools, but it’s important that they don’t become
dependent on us.”

- The DevOps Handbook p. 118

# Yet another rant

You are not DevOps if your company has a DevOps team. 

I had a discussion recently where I heard from this company in Denmark saying:

“We have a dedicated DevOps team, so that the developers don’t have to concern themselves about pipelines and deployment.”

That is antithetical to the goal of DevOps. Unless everyone is responsible for the whole pipeline, you are not doing DevOps.

That company calls itself DevOps but is actually doing the opposite.

# DevOps culture = Review culture

It's a culture of transparency.

The larger the change, ,the longer  to get reviews completed.

# Pair programming


*What do you personally think about it?*

There are no wrong answers.

---

# A quote

> I can’t help wondering if pair programming is nothing more than code review on steroids... The advantage of pair programming is  its  gripping  immediacy:  it  is  impossible  to ignore  the  reviewer  when  he  or  she  is  sitting  right  next  to you.


> Most  people  will  passively  opt  out  [of reviewing code] if given the choice. With pair programming, that’s  not  possible.  Each  half  of  the  pair  has  to  understand the code, right then and there, as it’s being written. Pairing may  be  invasive,  but  it  can  also  force  a  level  of communication that you’d otherwise never achieve.”

\- Jeff Atwood, One of the founders of Stack Exchange

# Slower but better

> paired  programmers  are  15%  slower  than  two independent individual programmers, while “error-free” code  increased  from  70%  to  85%.  Since  testing  and debugging are often many times more costly than initial programming,  this  is  an  impressive  result.  Pairs typically  consider  more  design  alternatives  than programmers working alone and arrive at simpler, more maintainable  designs;  they  also  catch  design  defects early.

\- Dr. Laurie Williams (Study performed in 2001)

# After the holiday

Please read all the material before the guest lecture. 

Let the guest lecture inspire you. 

There is dedicated time to discuss the more philosophical aspects of DevOps and a chance for you to be critical of the concepts after the holiday. 

But for now, focus on understanding the concepts and the literature.
