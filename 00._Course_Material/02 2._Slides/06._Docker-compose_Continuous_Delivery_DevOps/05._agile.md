# Historical View: NOT! agile

Software __engineers__ created software **blueprints**.

Before you could even start implementing (coding) you had to do:

- Feasibility study, Market research

- Risk analysis

- Requirement analysis

- Write thorough specification

- System and software design

- Feature extraction and estimation

# Discuss: What are the problems with the waterfall model?

# Note: The waterfall model has its place

For some projects the waterfall model is the right choice. For instance, when there is only one iteration needed before the project is done. 

Also, analyzing and planning before coding is extremely important, especially for large systems. 

Agile development does not eliminate those steps.
Instead it allows one to move back and forth between the steps.

# Let's be critical!

Research into the state of agile in the industry: 

https://www.itpro.com/software/agile-development-is-fading-in-popularity-at-large-enterprises-and-developer-burnout-is-a-key-factor

Problems: 

- Culture clash: Organizational resistance
- Lack of leadership support
- Siloed teams 

> “The larger the organization, the more likely it is to use a hybrid model,” the report said, noting that bigger teams are also more likely to still use waterfall.

The research still finds value in agile. It finds it to be best in small organizations.
