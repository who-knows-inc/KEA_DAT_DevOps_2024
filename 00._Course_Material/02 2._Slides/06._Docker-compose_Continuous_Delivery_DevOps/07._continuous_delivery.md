# Same discussion again

> A CI system clones the codebase for the software under consideration from a source control system such as GitHub, builds the software into an artifact that can be a binary, a tar archive, or a Docker image, and, very importantly, also runs unit and/or integration tests for the software. A CD system deploys the artifacts built by the CI system to a target environment. This deployment can be automated for nonproduction environments, but usually includes a manual approval step for production. A more advanced type of such systems is a continuous delivery platform, which automates the deployment step to production and is capable of rolling back the deployment based on metrics obtained from monitoring and logging platforms.

*Do you consider anything off about the definition above?*

<details> 
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  
  The definition above seems to consider building Docker images as part of Continuous Integration.
  
  Most other sources would not agree with this. 
  It's important to understand that the responsibility of each step is fluid and defined differently in different organizations.

# Deploying a Docker container to GitHub Packages

Remember to specify the correct image name under the organizations namespace in the docker-compose file. 

For instance:

```yml
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    image: ghcr.io/<org-name>/<image-name>:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/usr/src/app
      - backend_node_modules:/usr/src/app/node_modules
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      DATABASE_HOST: db
```
