# CI/CD/CD

* Continuous Integration

Pushing code to a Version Control System (VCS such as git etc.).

* Continuous Delivery

Packaging your code (We will create Docker images).

* Continuous Deployment

Deploy to a server.

We will look differently at continuous delivery vs. deployment in this course, but we will call it CI/CD.

# Overview of CI/CD/CD

Goal: automation. 
Term: Pipelines

![CI/CD](./assets_ci_cd/ci_cd_cd.png)

---

# Continuous Integration (CI)

  - Developers frequently merge code changes into a central repository

  - Automatically builds and tests merged code

  - Detects integration issues early on

  - Goal: Resolve problems early and quickly

---

# Continuous Delivery (CD)

  - Ensures merged and tested code is always in a releasable state

  - Automated build process

  - Goal: To have code ready for release

---

# Continuous Deployment (CD)

  - Approach that emphasizes continuously delivering new features and improvements

  - Integrates feedback from users and stakeholders

  - Iterates on the product

  - Continuously deploys updates

  - Provides value at a faster pace

# Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment

There are many different interpretations of the two terms.

Historically, the continuous delivery was the first term to exist. Contiuous deployment is a more recent term.

For some the two terms are interchangeable. 

For others, continuous delivery has been superseded by the term continuous deployment.

One interpretation is that continuous delivery requires a manual step to deploy to production, while continuous deployment is fully automated (hands-off deployments).

---

# This course's interpretation of Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment

**Continuous Delivery**: Deliver build artifacts. In our case we will build Docker images and publish them to a container registry.

**Continuous Deployment**: Deploy to production. In our case we will deploy the Docker images to a server and run them.

You don't have to agree with this interpretation, but we use it to make a clear distinction between delivering artifacts and deploying to production.

Beware that you might end up in a job that uses the terms differently.
