# Python Build Tools

I have placed an optional tutorial here [Python Build Tools / Virtual Environments](./assets_build_tools/python_build_tools.md) if you are interested in the different types of ways to create virtual environments in Python.

I really recommend using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
