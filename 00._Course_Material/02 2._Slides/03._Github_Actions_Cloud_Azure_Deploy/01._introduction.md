# DevOps or not?

DevOps is not always the answer.

Projects and products are not DevOps, teams are.

# Weekly DevOps pep-talk!

DevOps principle:

Reduce WIP (Work In Progress).

Limit active branches. Merge branches to trunk at least daily.

Avoid long-lived branches.

# Simple is always best

Let's circle back to React. Given how simple the frontend is, is it the right choice?

How does the frontend benefit from a component based web framework?

It's also on me for not properly explaining that the website will not grow in complexity much.

I do not grade higher if you chose a more complex solution than what is needed, even if you spent more time on it. 

Only if it comes with additional benefits such as scalability, maintainability, etc.

Remember, during the exam everything should pass the "why" test. 

If you want to put in an extra effort right away, then use that energy on creating tests. Unfortunately, we won't cover that until much later.
