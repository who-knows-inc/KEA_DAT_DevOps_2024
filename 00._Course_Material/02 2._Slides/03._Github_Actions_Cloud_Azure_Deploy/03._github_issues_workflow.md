# What is the relevance of `jq`?

`jq` (JSON query) comes pre-installed in Github Action Ubuntu runners. 

We can use it to parse dense (no-space) JSON output into a readable format.

---

# jq

#### Using `jq` locally. 

```bash
$ brew install jq
```

```powershell
$ choco install jq -y
```

Then try to run this:

```bash
$ echo '{"hello":123}' | jq
```

**Note**: The difference between `“` and `‘` matters!

# Let's try to automate publishing a comment every time an issue is created

What is a GitHub Issue? Why is auto-commenting useful?

---

# GitHub Actions - Context

Contexts inject useful information into the server environment. 

Can be accessed via `${{ <context> }}`.

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts

For example, we can access repository meta information through `${{ github }} `. 

*Let's look for where the issue number is defined.*

---

# Dump the context to examine it

```yaml
name: Create a comment on new issues
permissions:
  issues: write
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
jobs:
  comment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: "Dump GitHub context"
        run: echo '${{ toJson(github) }}' | jq
```

*Where is the issue number?*

---

# Found it?

Under issue it is called "number". 

Note: toJson is a utility provided by GitHub Actions.

---

# Use the following package

https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-or-update-comment

But replace issue-number: 1 with: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}

```yaml
      - name: Create comment
        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v3
        with:
          issue-number: 1
          body: |
            This is a multi-line test comment
            - With GitHub **Markdown** :sparkles:
            - Created by [create-or-update-comment][1]
            
            [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-comment
          reactions: '+1'

```
