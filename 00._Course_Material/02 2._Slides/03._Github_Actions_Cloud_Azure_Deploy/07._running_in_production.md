# PM2 - Running Node.js in production - Part I

Install PM2:

# PM2 - Running Node.js in production - Part II

# Python in production

The same is true for Python. `gunicorn` is recommended for production. 

Here is how to run the Flask application with 4 worker processes. 

```bash
$ gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
```

Also in the server configuration in Flask remember to set `DEBUG=FALSE`.

There are many benefits such as HTTP caching, load balancing etc. 

We will explore them when we talk about security.
