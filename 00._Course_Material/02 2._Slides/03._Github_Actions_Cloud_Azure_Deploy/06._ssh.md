# Try to answer these questions in pairs

1. *If a GitHub Action needs to SSH into a server, which key should be defined in the GitHub Action: public or private?*

2. *If I have provisioned a server and I want to SSH into it from my local machine, which key do I use: public or private?*

3. *If I have provisioned a server and want to configure it to allow SSH access from my other local machine with a different SSH key, which key do I save on the server: public or private?*

Number 3 can be achieved by pasting your key in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server.

# SSH Config - A helpful tip

So you don't have to remember or write keep the IP address close. 


Here is how you define it. In the `~/.ssh/config` file. 

Add something like this:

```bash
Host devopscourse
    HostName 169.89.31.226
    User admin
```

Now, instead of having to type `ssh admin@169.89.31.226` every time you can simply invoke it with:

```bash
$ ssh devopscourse
```
