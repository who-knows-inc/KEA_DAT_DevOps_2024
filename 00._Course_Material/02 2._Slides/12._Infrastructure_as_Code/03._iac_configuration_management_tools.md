# IaC tools - The definition of IaC

A quick note about the definition of IaC and how we use it in the course:

`1.` [**Broad Definition**] IaC: Any tool that uses code to define anything related to our infrastracture.

Example: Configuration Management Tools are also called IaC even though their focus is on what to do once the resource has been provisioned. 

`2.` [**Narrow Definition**] IaC: A specific type of tool that allows us to provision cloud resources.

--- 

Even though `1` is technically correct definition which encompasses `2`, from here on out, I will colloquially use IaC in the narrow sense of definition `2`.

Ansible is the exception, it can do both. 

<span style="font-size: small;">While we are on the topic of definitions: Provisioning translates best to "Oprettelse" or "Udrulning".</span>

# IaC tools - Cloud Provider Agnostic

We are interested in a tool that isn't too proprietary and which doesn't bolt us down to a certain cloud provider. 

Very large companies use several cloud providers and a cloud provider agnostic solution would be optimal for them:

[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/): Infrastructure as code in general-purpose languages like JavaScript, Python, etc.

[Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/): Uses declarative YAML to define services with support for many cloud providers. 

<span style="font-size: small;">Note: Not to be confused with serverless functions or the concept of a serverless cloud service.</span>

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/): Automates cloud provisioning and config management with YAML.

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/): Define cloud and on-prem resources with versionable files.

<span style="font-size: small;">We will pick Terraform for being the most widely used of all.</span>

# Terraform

Maintains a dependency graph which is useful to know what order to create or destroy in. 

Keeps track through a state through the Terraform state file.

Collaborate and keep track of changes to your infrastructure in VCS. 

Declarative: Define the infrastructure you want, it manages how to achieve that.

# Terraform alternative

OpenTofu is an open source fork of Terraform made because of changes in their licensing.

Though the code for Terraform is also available:
