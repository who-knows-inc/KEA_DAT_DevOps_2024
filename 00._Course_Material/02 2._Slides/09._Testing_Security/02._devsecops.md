# How is DevSecOps different from DevOps + Security?

Security is automated and becomes part of every step of CI/CD.

All developers become responsible of security.

The security team becomes advisors rather than police.

---

# The Phoenix Project

According to **The Unicorn Project**: The security team should work to help the DevOps mission of getting value to the customer faster in a secure way rather then strike paranoia.

# Motivation: why automate tests? - Shifting security left

> [...] This shortage is even worse in Infosec - the ratio of engineers in Development, Operations and Infosec in a typical technology organization is 100:10:1. When Infosec is that outnumbered, without automation and integrating information security into the daily work of Dev and Ops, Infosec can only do compliance checking, which is the opposite of security engineering - and besides, it also makes everyone hate us.

\- James Wicket (Creator of the Gauntlt security tool and organaizer of DevOpsDays Austin and Lonestar Application Security conference)

# SAST vs. DAST - And tools

## SAST: Static Application Security Testing

Also called white-box testing.

SonarQube, Checkmarx, Fortify, Veracode, etc.

## DAST: Dynamic Application Security Testing

Also called black-box testing.

OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, etc.

# Security Gates in CI/CD

- Pre-commit (static analysis, dependency scanning)

- Pre-merge (code review)

- Pre-deployment (testing)

- Post-deployment (monitoring)

---

# Tool that delivers security in CI/CD: Jfrog Xray

End-to-end security and compliance for your software supply chain.

# Monitor

In a professional setting where security matters, you should monitor the following:

- traffic

- access

- file changes

etc. 

Dashboard tool: Zabbix.

---

# Red-Team vs Blue-Team

Red team:

- Attackers

Blue team:

- Defenders

---

# Be prepared for a breach

Automate back-ups. 

Data is probably your most precious asset; don't lose it.

*What should you do if there is a breach?*

---

# GDPR

Inform the affected parties (users). Inform the authorities.

In the simulation, I do not expect you to adhere to GDPR if there is a data leak. Please don't contact datatilsynet.
