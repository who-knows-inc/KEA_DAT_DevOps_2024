# Security hardening for GitHub Actions

**Type**: Individual

**Motivation**: Make sure that you follow the best practices for security when using GitHub Actions.

---

## Reading material

Since it's important that all developers are aware of the security risks and best practices when using GitHub Actions, all group members should read the following documentation:

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions

You are **not** expected to read the link thoroughly. Just skim the page and see if anything applies to your project.

If you make any changes after reading the documentation, then make a note of it or tell your group members about it.
