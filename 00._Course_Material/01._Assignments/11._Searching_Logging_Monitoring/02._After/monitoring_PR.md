# Monitoring PR

**Type**: Individual

**Deadline**: Before the last week's lecture

## The task

In the [repositories.py](/repositories.py) file the following key-value pair exists:

```python
"monitoring_dashboard_url": "http(s)://<IP/DOMAIN>/<MonitoringURL>"
```

Please update the value of the key `monitoring_dashboard_url` with the URL of your monitoring dashboard.

---

## Access / Credentials

You can choose to either have:

- A public dashboard

- A dashboard that requires a login

In the latter case I will share credentials on Teams and you should create a user with those credentials. 

All groups will get the same credentials.

I encourage you to check out each other's dashboards but please do not break anything.
