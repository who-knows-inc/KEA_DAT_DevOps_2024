**Type**: Group work

**Deadline**: Before next class

## The task

I have been contacted by a venture capital fund. Some of their investors have shown interest in becoming angel investors in your company. 

They have requested a basic report on the KPIs of your application.

* CPU load on the server.

* Total amount of users.

* Cost of the infrastructure / complete setup (monthly and/or total so far).

* [Optional] Total amount of active users.

* [Optional] Average amount of searches per day.

Bring them to class next time and be prepared to answer how you calculated these values.
