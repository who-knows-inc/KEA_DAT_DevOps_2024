# Let them search

Users are crazy about your product and wish that they could search for more content than just programming. 

**Type**: Group work

**Motivation**: Learn to scrape and index webpages. 

---

## Requirements

Scrape and index webpages. Make them searchable.

---

## Scope

You will not be able to scrape the entire internet and you must select few websites. 

You should log the searches to see what the users are searching for.

You will not be evaluated by the scale of your indexing operation but the scalability of your solution. 

Create a proof of concept that could last a long time. Therefore, using Github Actions schedules is not a good idea because there are multiple limitations.
