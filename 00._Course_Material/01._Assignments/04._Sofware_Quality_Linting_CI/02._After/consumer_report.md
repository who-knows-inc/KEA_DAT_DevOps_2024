# Consumer Report!

A consumer report has revealed a change in the market! 

**Type**: Group work

**Deadline**: Before the simulation next week. If you are pressed for time, just create the route that returns the correct response type and solve this task at a later date. 

---

## Description

Consumers have become highly interested in the weather recently. Create a weather page that displays the forecast. 

---

## Motivation

This is an excellent opportunity to: 

1. Integrate with a 3rd party service. 

2. Test the integration as part of your pipelines later on.

---

## Considerations

Research services that provide weather forecasts. Consider limitations such as cost and allotted API calls over a certain timeframe.

Decide on how to integrate with the service. Frontend or backend? Are any of the choices problematic in your setup? 

Consider scalability. How would you handle a large number of users without burdening the service? You don't have to solve anything here, but you should have a plan for it.

Consider limitations (allotted API calls over a certain timeframe) and how to possibly cache the result at a fixed interval.
