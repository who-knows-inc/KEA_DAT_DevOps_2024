# Setup GitHub Discussion

**Type**: Group work

**Motivation**: Using Github Discussions instead of a closed forum adhers to the DevOps principle of transparency.

## Requirement

Your group is not required to use GitHub Discussions. However, you must use a public forum for discussions. 

The requirement is transparency. Github Discussions is an obvious tool to achieve this, but you could use similar tools as long as they allow for public and anonymous access.
