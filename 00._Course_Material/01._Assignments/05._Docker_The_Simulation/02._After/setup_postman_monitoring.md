# Setup Postman Monitoring

Monitors will run in Postman Cloud and send you emails if the tests fail.

**Type**: Group work

---

## Create collection

You must create a collection in Postman first. A collection is a group of requests.

https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/first-steps/creating-the-first-collection/

---

## Create a request

Click on the "+" button to create a new request and for now write a placeholder request URL. I wrote `localhost:8080/api/movies`.

---

## Save request

Click on the `ðŸ’¾ Save` button on the top right corner of the request.

Give it a name and assign it to the collection.

---

## Set variables

Highlight the URL and tool tip will pop up with a `Set as variable` button. Click on it.

<img src="./assets_postman_monitoring/set_variables.png">

Create a BASE_URL and PORT variable and set the scope to the collection. 

---

## Edit variables

You can edit variables by clicking on the `...` icon on the upper left side (the collection drawer) and selecting edit.

Choose the `Variables` tab and edit the variables.

## Create tests

On the request page, click on the `Tests` tab:

You can optionally watch the API test segment of the video below to learn more:

---

## Write a test

In the snippets on the right side select `Status code: Code is 200`;

```javascript
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});
```

---

## Run the test

Send the request and select the `Test Result` tab in the lower bottom (the response part).

---

## Improve the test

```javascript
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response time is less than 200ms", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(200);
});

pm.test("Response body is present", function () {
    const body = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(body).to.include("data");
    pm.expect(body.data).to.be.an("array");
});
```

    <h1>Runners</h1>
</div>

## Collection runner

A runner automates running a collection of requests instead of having to run each of them manually.

You can find the runner in the the bottom right corner of the Postman app.

<img src="./assets_postman_monitoring/runner_button.png">

---

## Adding the collection to the runner

Simply drag the collection from the collection drawer to the runner.

<img src="./assets_postman_monitoring/adding_collection_to_runner.png">

---

## Run the runner

Click on the `Run` button in the runner (bottom right).

---

## Automate Run

<img src="./assets_postman_monitoring/automate_run.png">

---

# Schedule run

You can schedule a run to run at a specific time and send you emails if the tests fail.

Postman cloud runs the tests for you and you don't have to setup a server.

---


## Schedule CI/CD - I

You can run a runner in CI/CD. For instance, you can make test that all the routes are working before deploying to production.

Or you could immediately role back in production in case of a failed test.

## Schedule CI/CD - II

Click on `Configure command` and you will be able to get a snippet and instruction on how to add the code to your CI/CD pipeline.

## Create a Monitor

Click on `Monitors` on the left sie and selct `Create a Monitor`:

<img src="./assets_postman_monitoring/create_a_monitor.png">

Give the monitor a name, select the collection.

---

## Run the monitor

## [Optional] Consider creating a team to enable collaboration

https://web.postman.co/purchase?quantity=1&utm_source=postman&utm_medium=app_desktop&utm_term=upgrade&utm_content=navbar

Beware that free teams have an account of up to 3 members.

It is fine not to create a Postman team and just have one person be in charge of the Postman monitoring.

---

## What now?

Now that you have tried to create a monitor for a single test, you can consider writing duplicated tests in `Post-response` for hte collection. 

https://learning.postman.com/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/intro-to-scripts/

As an example, if getting a status `200` for all requests is expected then you can put the test as a `Post-response` instead of pasting it onto each endpoint.
